the script that is shown for OCR and verification has a different outcome than originally planned,
we found out along the way that there's already existing framework for OCR and face verification, 

earlier we found that there is Google Tesseract that is used by many people for OCR problem, although the outcome isn't as great as we expected
we discuss a little bit of OCR with some of our friend that is experienced in Machine Learning and we conclude that we need a better and built our own model
though the time doesn't really let us do that, but we keep that in mind to improve our product for future development

and to verify the face of the holder of the ID and the face on the ID itself can be done using an existing library that is DeepFace

so before running the script it's important to get install Google Tesseract and add it to path before we can use it on pytesseract wrapper,

we can install deepface directly on pip, and the wrapped model will automatically downloaded when we change between model,
after some tuning and test we found out that using FaceNet model is much more better on Id card rather than using the default deepface model that is
VGG-Face.
